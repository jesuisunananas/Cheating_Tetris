I wanted to try out making a simple game in C++ and I wanted to try out a graphics library so  
I ended up making Tetris in C++ using Raylib. The hardest part of this project was the setup,  
and it gives me a new appreciation for why we need CMake, Ninja, etc. type of programs. Initially  
I intended on making the down arrow key move the piece down but I accidentally reversed the direction,  
making it go up. I thought this was pretty funny so I have kept it in, hence the name.

Obviously there are a lot of room for improvements but I'm pretty happy with what it is. I really  
do like Tetris.

Further Improvements:
  - I really want to try making a 3d-tetris game, so this is my jumping off point
